# The Messaging Service ShowCase (MSSC) Application
The Messaging Service Showcase application is quite simple.  It is a [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) API (see [NR Email Microservice](https://github.com/bcgov/nr-email-microservice)) and a [React.js](https://reactjs.org) UI (see [frontend](./README.md)).  In production, both the backend and frontend are placed behind a reverse proxy (see [reverse-proxy](../reverse-proxy/README.md)).

## Frontend
The frontend is a React.js application which provides an example UI for calling the Common Messaging Service. At this time, the only messaging transport is email.  This application demonstrates how to send both plain text emails and html emails to multiple recipients and includes support for attachments.

Frontend is a React.js application that was created using [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## User Authentication - OIDC
We are using a KeyClock realm to provide user authentication.  We are using [Open ID Connect (OIDC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID_Connect) and we are using the [oidc-client](https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js) library to facilitate the calls and handshakes required.  The microservice and frontend application will need matching configurations to connect to the realm and provide/check tokens.  Email (and upload attachments) and Message Status require a user is logged in.  At this time, we are not checking roles, but the user must be added to the realm using GitHub or IDIR credentials.


### Reverse Proxy and Caddy
In production, the frontend is behind a [reverse proxy](../reverse-proxy/README.md).  This allows us to easily serve the application under any path structure we choose.  To acheive this portability, we set the homepage to "." in [package.json](package.json).  The frontend itself (once it has been built and minified for production), is served in it's own container on [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com).  See [Caddyfile](Caddyfile).

In our Caddyfile, we expect certain environment variables:
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| UI_SERVICE_PORT | exposed port to access caddy server ex. 2015 |
| PATH_ROOT | url path  ex. localhost:2015/mypath |
| STATIC_FILES_PATH | physical path to the files ex. build |

### Application Environment Variables
Environment variables that we need can be set for developers in a root file .env.development.local - this should be ignored for our git commits.  Or they can be set at the command line.
We need to tell the build what path we expect to be served at (ex. /pr-5 for pull requests, /mssc for production), and that will be used to hit our relative backend api path.  All environment variables used in the application code must start with REACT\_APP\_

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| REACT_APP_UI_ROOT | same as PATH_ROOT, /pr-5, mssc, etc |
| REACT_APP_PUBLIC_URL | full url to the root of the application.  This is to expose callback urls for authentication. |
| REACT_APP_OIDC_ISSUER | For User Authentication, we need the KeyCloak Realm Issuer URL.  ex. https://sso-dev.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/auth/realms/98r0z7rz |
| REACT_APP_OIDC_CLIENT_ID | For User Authentication, we need the Client ID.  This must match the backend service configuration. |

### Notes
Upon startup, we immediately call the mssc api healthcheck at /api/v1/health.  This will check to see if the service client is configured correctly and has the expected permissions.  It will also check to see if the Common Messaging Service is up and available.  As part of the health check, we consume configuration for attachments and sender.  If the health check fails, or if the underlying service client does not have permissions to send, then the email form is disabled.

When sending an email, we first upload attachments (if provided) at /api/v1/uploads, then call to send the mail (passing along the uploaded file information) at /api/v1/email.

The form will be validated before we send.  We do not verify that email addresses are valid and reachable.

If the message is delivered to CMSG api, we will consider that a success.  This does not mean that CMSG has successfully delivered the email to the recipients, only that CMSG has received the request to deliver email, and that the request is valid.

#### tinymce
We have used [tinymce](https://www.tiny.cloud/features) to provide a rich text editor for our html emails.  We use the installed features from node_modules, we do not use tinymce cloud, nor do we explicitly host the tinymce javascript, css, themes etc.  See [src/htmlText](/src/htmlText) for more.

#### attachments (react-dropzone)
We use [react-dropzone](https://react-dropzone.netlify.com) for handling attachments.  This allows drag-and-drop or file dialog selection.  We have arbitrarily limited the number of attachments (3) and their size (5MiB).  We have also limited the type to pdf as this is currently the only supported file type in Common Message Service.  These are configured in the backend and we receive the configuration during our health check.

Only valid files will be accepted, and the UI does provide a means to remove attachments.  A warning will appear if all the files dropped or selected fail to meet the configured criteria.


## Project scripts

Assumption is you have installed node 10.15.3 and npm 6.4.1.

``` sh
cd frontend
npm install
```

### Run the application locally
Note that by default, we are running on localhost:3000.  By default, a local instance of the [email microservice](https://github.com/bcgov/nr-email-microservice) will run on localhost:8080.  In our package.json, we set a proxy to localhost:8080.  This means that we can run frontend and backend locally in development mode to debug both sides. All http calls that would go to our application root will proxy to the backend running on localhost:8080.

``` sh
npm run start
```

### Build the application
For production releases, we need to build the application.  Build will use react-scripts and produce a production ready distribution at frontend/build.

``` sh
export REACT_APP_API_ROOT=/pr-5
export REACT_APP_UI_ROOT=/pr-5
export REACT_APP_PUBLIC_URL=https://mssc-dev.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/pr-5
export REACT_APP_OIDC_ISSUER=https://sso-dev.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/auth/realms/98r0z7rz
export REACT_APP_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=mssc

npm run build
```

### Build and run in Caddy locally
The following will show how one can build the production code and run it locally in Caddy.
Generally, REACT\_APP\_API\_ROOT and REACT\_APP\_UI\_ROOT are the same as PATH\_ROOT, but for serving locally, the api maybe hosted elsewhere.  See [reverse-proxy](../reverse-proxy) for a better example.

``` sh
cd frontend

export REACT_APP_API_ROOT=http://localhost:8080
export REACT_APP_UI_ROOT=
export REACT_APP_PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:2016
export REACT_APP_OIDC_ISSUER=https://sso-dev.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/auth/realms/98r0z7rz
export REACT_APP_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=mssc-localhost-frontend
npm run build

export PATH_ROOT=
export UI_SERVICE_PORT=2016
export STATIC_FILES_PATH=./build

caddy -quic
```
