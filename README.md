# Natural Resources Messaging Service Showcase

This repository contains code to provide a simple UI for the [NR Email Microservice](https://github.com/bcgov/nr-email-microservice) and the Common Hosted Email Service ([CHES](https://github.com/bcgov/common-hosted-email-service.git)).  The Email Microservice provides an example implementation for use of the Common Messaging Service API (CMSG).  The [ches-backend](ches-backend/README.md) provides an example implementation for use of the CHES API.  We use [React.js](https://reactjs.org) for the frontend UI.
